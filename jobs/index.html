If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach out, grab people, and help them them change the world, then this is the job for you.</p>

<p>You will help evangelize, plan and execute our campaign and organizational development strategies. You will ensure that our projects are smoothly executed, while managing the operational needs of the organization.

You should understand and be able to express in ways that resonate with your audience the nuances and overarching themes of tech policy, free internet principles, and organizing on the ground and online.</p>

<p>We’d especially enjoy someone who has a wide interest in pulling off tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at their disposal – you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to pull off a really hard-hitting and exciting campaign for the right audience.</p>
