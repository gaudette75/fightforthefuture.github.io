  <h3>The Organization</h3>

  <p>Fight for the Future is a non-profit organization whose mission is to
    ensure that the web
    continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core. We
    primarily work on high value, fearless projects that can be seen by
    millions. The highlight of these efforts so far is the largest online
    protest in history, internet-wide strike against the web censorship
    bills SOPA and PIPA, and is an example of the impact a passionate few
    can have when engaging with the larger web community; see
    <a href="http://americancensorship.org">americancensorship.org</a>,
    <a href="http://sopastrike.com">sopastrike.com</a>,
    <a href="http://freebieber.org">freebieber.org</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/pipa">fightforthefuture.org/pipa</a>.
    This could be a dream job.</p>

  <h3>Job Description.</h3>

  <p> Our organization is focused on developing high-impact campaigns that
    resonate with people and help them band together to exert their power.
    The Campaign Manager/ Evangelist position is one of the most important
    roles in our work - it is central to the organization and its
    effectiveness. If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach
    out, grab people, and help them change the world, then this is the job
    for you. We&rsquo;re looking for someone to continue to build that
    organization with us, from the ground up.</p>

  <p>We&#x27;re looking for someone smart and savvy and who can be funny and
    playful with ideas; we&#x27;re looking for someone who can speak to
    people&#x27;s humor, fears and what gets them going; and we want someone
    who has purposeful humor and creativity as well as poignant ideas and
    language that can cut through political gridlock and debate.</p>

  <p>We look for people with a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on
    a wide range of political issues, and especially on tech and policy. We
    want you to be a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an
    idea out of ordinary interaction and frustrations / struggles.</p>

  <h3>Desired Skills &amp; Experience</h3>

  <p>Ideally, you should have experience with or want to have experience
    with:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>running campaigns on high-impact issues</li>
    <li>managing campaigns and responses to a fast-changing, dynamic field
    </li>
    <li>working with a large variety of people, groups, and companies and
      spreading the message to as many stakeholders as possible
    </li>
    <li>fighting against money in politics and heavily-funded lobbying
      teams
    </li>
    <li>playing a key role in the planning and strategy of campaign
      organizing and organization growth
    </li>
    <li>leading or starting coalitions</li>
    <li>finding and securing new sources for campaigns</li>

  </ol>

  <h3>You should also have experience:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Running online campaigns that grow fast</li>
    <li>Crafting exciting and persuasive actions</li>
    <li>Using online and traditional media to achieve broad visibility
      (including by talking with press)
    </li>
    <li>Fighting hard for something</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Compensation.</strong> Market Rate / Commensurate with
    Experience</p>

  <p><strong>Location, terms.</strong> The team will be 100% remote-&mdash;no
    need to commute or relocate. If you&#x27;re interested in relocation,
    let us know. We&rsquo;d start working with you on a contract basis at an
    hourly rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with
    competitive salary and benefits to the right person.</p>

  <p><strong>To apply:</strong> If you&rsquo;re interested, send links to
    work you&rsquo;ve done to <a href="mailto:tycheng+campaigns@gmail.com">tycheng+campaigns@gmail.com</a>.
    Show us that you excel at the things we&rsquo;re looking for. If you
    like, include links to or samples of your writing&ndash;ideally in
    situations where you&rsquo;re writing to persuade a group of people to
    believe something or take an action. Include as much relevant
    information as possible: significant things you&rsquo;ve done, projects
    you&rsquo;ve worked on, etc. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don&rsquo;t
    exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren&rsquo;t
    activism related (e.g. starting a business, or being a musician).</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> we expect this job announcement to reach a lot
    of people who are very politically active, but who may not be sold on
    the significance of this particular cause. So here&rsquo;s a quick
    summary of how we see the threat and the opportunity:</p>

  <p>First, technology is increasingly the foundation for social
    participation and the pursuit of justice. We depend on a combination of
    software, devices, and the internet to get news, read books, organize
    others&mdash; a slew of essential activities. Second, digital technology
    contains a basic social justice: once something gets made, it costs
    relatively little to give everyone access.</p>

  <p>This means two things: 1) to preserve our existing freedoms and
    institutions we have to fight to keep their technological underpinnings
    free from interference. 2) If we&rsquo;re successful we win much more
    than that: a world where everyone has equal access to many of humanity&rsquo;s
    most valuable creations (knowledge, cultural expression, and the digital
    tools to make more).</p>

  <p>There are several excellent organizations working on the same set of
    issues; we can be very effective working in collaboration with them by
    focusing on public-facing campaigns and employing a different mix of
    tactics. The organization&rsquo;s founding team also has an interesting
    track record in doing just this.</p>
