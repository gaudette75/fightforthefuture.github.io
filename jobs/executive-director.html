  <p><strong>Compensation.</strong> Market Rate / Commensurate with
    Experience</p>

  <p><strong>Location.</strong> The team will be 100% remote-&mdash;no need
    to commute or relocate. If you&#x27;re interested in relocation, let us
    know. We&rsquo;d start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly
    rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive
    salary and benefits to the right person.</p>

  <p>To apply: If you&rsquo;re interested, send links to work you&rsquo;ve
    done to
    <a href="mailto:tycheng+edoper@gmail.com">tycheng+edoper@gmail.com</a>.
    Show us that you excel at the things we&rsquo;re looking for. If you
    like, include links to or samples of your writing&ndash;ideally in
    situations where you&rsquo;re writing to persuade a group of people to.
    Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you&rsquo;ve
    done, projects you&rsquo;ve worked on, etc. Being well-rounded is a
    plus, so don&rsquo;t exclude significant skills or achievements just
    because they aren&rsquo;t activism related (e.g. starting a business, or
    being a musician).</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> we expect this job announcement to reach a lot
    of people who are very politically active, but who may not be sold on
    the significance of this particular cause. So here&rsquo;s a quick
    summary of how we see the threat and the opportunity:</p>

  <p>First, technology is increasingly the foundation for social
    participation and the pursuit of justice. We depend on a combination of
    software, devices, and the internet to get news, read books, organize
    others&mdash; a slew of essential activities. Second, digital technology
    contains a basic social justice: once something gets made, it costs
    relatively little to give everyone access.</p>

  <p>This means two things: 1) to preserve our existing freedoms and
    institutions we have to fight to keep their technological underpinnings
    free from interference. 2) If we&rsquo;re successful we win much more
    than that: a world where everyone has equal access to many of humanity&rsquo;s
    most valuable creations (knowledge, cultural expression, and the digital
    tools to make more).</p>

  <p>There are several excellent organizations working on the same set of
    issues; we can be very effective working in collaboration with them by
    focusing on public-facing campaigns and employing a different mix of
    tactics. The organization&rsquo;s founding team also has an interesting
    track record in doing just this.</p>
