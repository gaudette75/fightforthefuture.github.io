<p>This just in! We&rsquo;ve teamed up with our friends at domain registrar Namecheap to bring the overwhelming public outcry for real net neutrality protections directly to the agency&rsquo;s doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>As the hours count down to the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality comment deadline, we have obtained a permit to park a truck with a giant video billboard on top directly across the street from the FCC facing the agency&rsquo;s headquarters! It&rsquo;s amazing! We&rsquo;re attracting tons of attention already.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VobzCnTgrQt75LQwmkNGhFNlwvHDONpWxwWtNKB5wa0/viewform" target="_blank"><strong>Got something to say to the FCC? Send us a link to your video and we&rsquo;ll play it on the billboard!</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Are you in Washington, DC? </strong>Join us, Free Press, and Popular Resistance on Tuesday, September 16th as we gather near the billboard to call for the FCC to get out of DC and listen to the public! <a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/sept_16_fcc_action/" target="_blank"><strong>More info here.Â  </strong></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be here until the end of the day Tuesday playing a steady stream of videos about net neutrality. The FCC needs to hear from everyone &ndash; but not everyone can make it to DC to speak out. <strong>The billboard gives us all a platform from which to speak, just like the free and open Internet!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internet, send us your videos! Take a short 1-2 minute video of yourself explaining why net neutrality matters to you, and we&rsquo;ll play it on the billboard for Tom Wheeler and everyone at the FCC. Use the form below to submit your video or email it directly to ted@namecheap.com with the subject line &ldquo;Billboard submission.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Namecheap gets that Internet Freedom isn&rsquo;t just a good idea, it&rsquo;s a critical fight for the future of the entire web. Not only are they making the billboard action possible, but they&rsquo;re helping raise funds for Fight for the Future to support our ongoing work for net neutrality. <strong><a href="http://netneutrality.com" target="_blank">Head over to NetNeutrality.com and share the video there and they&rsquo;ll donate to us each time!</a></strong></p>
