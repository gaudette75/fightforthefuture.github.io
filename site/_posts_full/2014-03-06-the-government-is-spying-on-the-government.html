<p id="docs-internal-guid-4b8afc34-98ee-ee1f-7da8-aea62bb2a6d7"><span>Hey team,</span></p>

<p><span>We’ve warned about this scenario before and now there’s proof. The CIA was just caught red-handed spying on staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee who were investigating the CIA&rsquo;s secret and highly controversial torture program.</span></p>
<p><span>This confirms some of our worst fears. It’s the ultimate abuse of power that calls our entire democracy into question. How screwed are we when the government has the power to intimidate or derail investigations into their own crimes? <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Here’s some links on that developing story:</span></p>
