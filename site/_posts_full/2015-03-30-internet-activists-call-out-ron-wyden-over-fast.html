If he turns his back on those values by supporting outdated and anti-democratic Fast Track legislation, his legacy will be forever tarnished. The film festival today was just one more reminder that the public is outraged that he’s even considering this deal, and if he cares about what his constituents have to say at all he will do the right thing.”</p><figure data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592"><img data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nm1izl7jXf1ri3xd7_540.jpg"/></figure><p>A few dozen people gathered on the National Mall to watch the film festival, snacking on free popcorn and enjoying several short videos including many sent directly from supporters and constituents who addressed Senator Wyden directly and asked him to do the right thing. The film fest kicked off with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">a viral video</a> of activists who followed the Senator around his home state of Oregon with a 30-foot blimp, which has already seen more than 160,000 views online. </p><p>Today’s event is the latest in an escalating series of online and offline protests focused on Senator Wyden. Last week, the Senator <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/114529025493/senator-ron-wyden-moves-dc-fundraising-dinner-at" target="_blank">moved a fundraising dinner</a> in Washington, DC at the last minute after Internet activist groups planned a protest outside. Last year, 25 tech companies including reddit, Namecheap, and Imgur sent a letter to Senator Wyden detailing their concerns with Fast Track. Online, activists have been pummeling the Senator with more than 35,000 tweets in recent weeks, and thousands of phone calls and emails.</p><p>The “Hey Ron Wyden! Film Festival” was organized by Fight for the Future, a digital rights group best known for their role in the massive protests against SOPA and in the recent fight for net neutrality.</p><figure data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592"><img data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nm1izz9IBD1ri3xd7_500.jpg"/></figure><p>###</p>
