<p id="docs-internal-guid-12bec1b7-e923-0f2a-9aa8-2b1b6cfa319a"><span>So today we did something a little absurd. </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank">We launched 535 websites. One for each member of Congress. </a></strong></p>
<p><span>Why? The battle over net neutrality in the U.S. is coming to a final showdown, and the outcome will affect every Internet user in the world. One year ago today, Verizon’s lawyers got our net neutrality protections struck down in court. [1] </span></p>
<p><span>Since then,</span><span> we’ve unleashed an Internet-sized can of whoop-ass</span><span> on the FCC, the White House, fence-sitting tech giants, Team Cable lobbyists, and anyone else standing in the way of keeping the Internet open and unfettered by corporate and government interference.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank">Click here to tell Congress to stand with the Internet or get out of the way!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The online free speech movement has gained so much ground that Comcast and Verizon are now begging the FCC to implement the rules that just a year ago today </span><span>they sued to strike down.</span><span> [2]</span></p>
<p><span>We’re winning. We we&rsquo;re winning so hard. </span><strong>There’s literally only one thing that can stop us now: partisan nonsense in Congress.</strong></p>
<p><span>I know what you’re thinking: partisan nonsense in Congress can ruin ANYTHING. You’re right. That’s why we’re pulling out the stops on this one. </span><span>We made every member of Congress their very own website showing where they stand on net neutrality. Are they with the public or in bed with corporate monopolies that want to regulate the Internet?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard" target="_blank">Click here to find out if your member of Congress is helping kill net neutrality. Then share.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Congress knows that the public is overwhelmingly in support of net neutrality. We need to let them know that there will be political consequences for any politician who betrays the open Internet. </span><span>These sites are just the first part of the plan, but they’re exactly the kind of attention politicians don’t like.</span><span> It’s like if we put up giant billboards with their faces on them, except it only costs a couple bucks per site :-) </span></p>
<p><span>Congress has been scared of the Internet ever since SOPA. </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank"><span><span>Let’s keep it that way.</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Yours for the web,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Jeff, Kevin, and Vasjen</span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. The FCC decision is coming up at the end of next month and we need to bring on more people so we can kick our campaigns up a notch. </span><a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><span>Please chip in $10 to help if you can!</span></a></p>
