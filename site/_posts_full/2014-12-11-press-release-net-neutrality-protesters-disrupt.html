<h3>Net Neutrality activists interrupt FCC meeting, unfurl “Reclassify Now!” banner behind commissioners</h3>
<p><span>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; This morning at 10:40am, net neutrality demonstrators interrupted the FCC’s monthly meeting by unfurling a large banner reading “Reclassify Now!” behind the seated FCC commissioners. The activists, both union members, were escorted from the room by security after speaking out and asking FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler why he continues to delay Title II net neutrality, which should have been voted on at today’s meeting.</span></p>

<p><span>Other activists inside the meeting held paper signs calling for reclassification of the Internet under Title without delay. Several stood up and spoke to Chairman Wheeler from the floor to ask why net neutrality was left off the agenda before being escorted from the room. Outside, a crowd of protesters gathered with signs reading “Save the Internet! and “Reclassify Under Title II!”</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Activist Vanessa Beck of PopularResistance.org, who participated in the action, said “Nearly 4 million people submitted comments to the FCC on net neutrality, a record number, and more than 99% supported reclassification under Title II. If the FCC was a truly democratic agency, we would have a Title II rule today. Chairman Wheeler needs to stop stalling and listen to the public.”</span></p>
<p><span>While demonstrators made their voices heard at the FCC, digital rights group Fight for the Future, who helped publicize the protests, also rallied support online launching a new feature on </span><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>CallTheFCC.com</span></a><span> that allows supporters to easily email FCC employees with a few clicks. The group has has helped drive more than </span><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/104245377138/press-release-net-neutrality-activists-give-the" target="_blank"><span>40,000 phone calls</span></a><span> to the FCC in recent months.</span></p>
<p><span>The disruption today was organized by PopularResistance.org, the activist group that helped lead </span><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>Occupy the FCC</span></a><span> and famously blockaded FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s driveway last month. Net neutrality supporters vowed to continue escalating their efforts until the FCC votes to approve Title II reclassification and protect the Internet from cable company abuse and censorship.</span><br/><br/><span>###</span></p>
