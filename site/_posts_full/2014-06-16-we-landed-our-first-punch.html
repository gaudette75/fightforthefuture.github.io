<p>Dear Fight for the Future member,<br/><br/>We know how to fight the NSA. Finally.<br/><br/>It’s been one year since the Snowden leaks and, with Reset the Net, I feel like we just landed our first real punch, and got our first real result. <strong>Now the question is: can we keep fighting?</strong><br/><br/>Reset the Net worked so well. Huge services like Tumblr, Wordpress, and Sendgrid announced new encryption that–thanks to Snowden–we <em>know</em> makes spying harder. Meanwhile, thousands of sites (including Minecraft, one of the world’s most-downloaded games) drove downloads of encrypted calling and texting tools all day on Thursday.<br/><br/>Not a techie? Well, to the NSA, that means our private conversations will increasingly look like this: “I9XJKigrOgyymB1oEtF37xoKDzXuS5NbbRGT5Rq4GA1VCJYC”<br/><br/>The scale of what we’re achieving is just staggering. Sendgrid alone delivers <em>billions</em> of emails each month. Now, those emails are encrypted, safer.<br/><br/><strong>So we can’t stop now, but this is intense work!</strong> Last week was a huge lift for our small team. We think we can get dozens, maybe <em>hundreds</em> more huge sites to step up. But to do it, we&rsquo;ll need a full-time organizer: someone to approach sites, convince them to join, and plan more days of action. <strong>Can you donate to keep Reset the Net going?</strong><br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s winning against NSA mass surveillance.</strong></a><br/><br/>Our tiny organization is facing a battle on <em>two</em> fronts. We are finally making dents in the NSA’s surveillance system, but meanwhile America’s cable monopolies are attacking the fundamental principles of the open Internet–the ones that make campaigns like this possible. <strong>Alone, either of these would be the fight of our lives. Together, it’s almost more than we can handle.</strong><br/><br/>But we think we can do both, and we have to: each win means so much. Reset the Net was 6 months of work. Now that the campaign structure is in place, we just need to keep adding sites to our roster, and encouraging sites who&rsquo;ve already joined to keep pushing the envelope.<strong> We don’t need expensive design or development help, just one driven full-time organizer.</strong> Someone who can keep nudging this snowball forward, until it becomes an avalanche. Can you pitch in?<br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s shutting down NSA mass surveillance, piece by piece.</strong></a><br/><br/>This is what victory looks like. Sincerely,<br/><br/>Evan, Holmes, Tiffiniy and the whole Fight for the Future team<br/><br/>P.S. We are serious. If this email goes well we are hiring an organizer right now. Interested?
