<p><span>Hey!<br/><br/></span><span>Thanks to you, the Internet Slowdown was a resounding success. More people took action to defend net neutrality in one day than ever before in history. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Click here to check out this inspiring infographic showing what we did together on September 10th. It will seriously make your day, unless you happen to be a Comcast lobbyist. </a></strong></p>

<p><span>The slowdown was so big it was impossible to ignore. Several members of Congress tweeted about how their phones were ringing off the hook, and we dominated the mainstream news headlines. More than 40,000 websites took part, including many of the most popular sites in the world, and at the peak of the day, there were more than 1,000 phone calls to congress </span><span>every minute!<br/><br/></span><span>This changes everything. Victory is more tangible now than ever before. But we still need to bring it home. <strong>Now that we’ve shown our strength, the giant Cable companies that are lobbying tooth and nail to destroy net neutrality will redouble their efforts</strong>, and work every connection they have to keep the public’s voice from being heard in Washington, DC.</span><span><br/><br/>There’s only one solution: we have to fight even harder, and grow our movement even larger, and we have to be ready to battle for the net for the long haul.</span></p>
<p><span>Organizing the Internet Slowdown day and hosting the website used up a huge amount of our resources. </span><strong>Will you chip in $5 (or more!) today to make sure we can keep the pressure on while we have so much momentum?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Yes, I will chip in today to save net neutrality!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>All of us here at Fight for the Future are so proud of the Internet right now. Now more than ever it&rsquo;s so clear how powerful the Internet really is as a platform for free speech, and how absolutely critical it is that we not only fight for it, but we fight to win.</span></p>
