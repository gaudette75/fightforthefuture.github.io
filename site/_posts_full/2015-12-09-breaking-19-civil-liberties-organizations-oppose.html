<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>December 9, 2015<br/></p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org </p><p>A group of 19 civil liberties organizations from across the political spectrum this morning issued a letter to the White House and Congress urging lawmakers to oppose the final “conferenced” version of a dangerous cyber bill that experts say will dramatically expand government surveillance while failing to make us safer from cyber attacks.</p><p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9t2hnplz4-aZXJEemJJNW8yM1U/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click here to view the letter and complete list of signers as a PDF.</a></b></p><p>“The final version of this bill is an insult to the public and puts all of us in greater danger of cyber attacks and government surveillance,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, who organized the letter, </b>“This was already a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation, and now even the meager privacy protections it provided have been gutted, exposing it for what it really is: a bill to dramatically expand abusive government spying.”<br/></p><p>The text of the letter is copied below. Signers include prominent civil liberties groups ranging from the American Library Association, Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press Education Fund to FreedomWorks, Campaign for Liberty, and R-Street.</p><p>###</p><p>December 9, 2015<b><br/></b></p><p>Dear President Barack Obama and Members of Congress,</p><p>The undersigned organizations urge you to oppose the newly negotiated “conference”  legislation that purports to resolve differences between H.R. 1560, which includes both the Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA) and the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015 (NCPAA), and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA, S. 754). The current version of these bills is the result of secret negotiations between the House and Senate intelligence committees at the expense of critical expert input from the House Committee on Homeland Security, and it loses any advantages and improvements in the Homeland Security Committee’s own cybersecurity bill, the NCPAA.</p><p>Many organizations and companies† opposed CISA in its earlier form because they believed it would damage Americans’ privacy without improving security. Civil liberties organizations’ concerns are well known. Companies share many of the same concerns. But companies also work hard to earn users’ trust when it comes to privacy. Without that trust, business suffers. Instead of addressing these concerns with the existing bills, the current proposal would build a government regime that makes it impossible for companies to guarantee the protection of customers’ civil liberties and privacy, while also failing to meaningfully improve cybersecurity.</p><p>Specifically, the text just negotiated is publicly reported to include the following gravely flawed changes to the passed bills. These changes would render it an unacceptably compromised piece of legislation that will be both unhelpful for cybersecurity and dangerous to Americans’ civil liberties. Specifically, It threatens to:</p><blockquote><p>-Create a loophole that would allow the President to remove the Department of Homeland Security, a civilian agency, as the lead government entity managing information sharing;</p><p>-Reduce privacy protections for Americans’ personal information;</p><p>-Overexpand the term “cyber threat&quot; to facilitate the prosecution of crimes unrelated to cybersecurity;</p><p>-Expand already broad liability protection for information disclosure;</p><p>-Preempt state, local or tribal disclosure laws on any cyberthreat information shared by or with a State, tribal, or local government; and</p><p>-Eliminate a directive to ensure data integrity.</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, these modifications worsen bills that already contained fundamental flaws. These bills, in particular CISA, would already:<br/></p><blockquote><p>-Dramatically expand the amount of sensitive information held by government agencies with dismal records on data security;</p><p>-Undermine civilian agency leadership of cybersecurity efforts;</p><p>-Institute blind, automatic transfer of personal information to intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, that would be authorized to use the information for non-cybersecurity purposes;</p><p>-Allow private entities to transfer irrelevant and sensitive personally identifiable information to the government without accountability;</p><p>-Allow companies and other entities to use “defensive measures” to protect &ldquo;information systems,&rdquo; which could unintentionally harm systems and computers of innocent parties; and</p><p>-Provide unnecessarily expansive liability protections to companies, thereby undermining customer trust and limiting judicial remedies for those whose rights are violated.</p></blockquote><p>Because it fails to resolve these weaknesses originally present within the three bills and makes new and alarming changes to them, we strongly object to the intelligence committee’s latest iteration of “cybersecurity” legislation and the undemocratic process that produced it. </p><p>Please join us in rejecting these new, troubling flaws and insisting that any version of cybersecurity legislation brought to the floor of either chamber draws heavily upon NCPAA and the expertise and extensive input of the House Committee on Homeland Security.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Advocacy for Principled Action in Government<br/>Amicus<br/>American Library Association<br/>Bill of Rights Defense Committee<br/>Campaign for Liberty<br/>Constitutional Alliance<br/>Defending Dissent Foundation<br/>Demand Progress<br/>DownsizeDC.org, Inc.<br/>Fight for the Future<br/>Free Press Action Fund<br/>FreedomWorks<br/>Media Alliance<br/>Niskanen Center<br/>OpenMedia<br/>OpenTheGovernment.org<br/>Our America Initiative<br/>Restore the Fourth<br/>R-Street Institute<br/>X-Lab</p>
