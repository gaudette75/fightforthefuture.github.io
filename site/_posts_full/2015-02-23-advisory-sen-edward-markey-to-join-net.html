<p><br/><i>What a victory for Net Neutrality means for hundreds of millions of Internet users<br/></i><br/>WASHINGTON — Supporters of the open Internet will convene a telephone press conference on Tuesday to set the stage for a momentous week for Net Neutrality. The speakers will include Sen. Edward Markey, former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, Free Press President and CEO Craig Aaron, Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer, and Center for Media Justice Executive Director Malkia Cyril.<br/><br/>On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to pass strong Net Neutrality rules under Title II of the Communications Act. The Feb. 24
 press call will discuss both this historic vote and two upcoming 
congressional hearings on Net Neutrality. It will feature brief remarks 
from leaders of the Net Neutrality movement followed by a Q&amp;A with 
reporters.<br/><br/>We are at a pivotal moment in the fight for Net 
Neutrality. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has responded to the overwhelming 
public support for strong Title II protections by proposing rules built 
on this legal framework. Since the FCC’s open Internet proceeding began 
in May 2014, a record-breaking 4 million people have submitted comments.
 A vast majority of commenters have urged the FCC to protect Internet 
users’ rights and prevent a few powerful phone and cable companies from 
controlling the future of communications.<br/><br/><b>Here are the details for the call:</b><br/><br/><b>WHAT: </b>Press Teleconference on Net Neutrality, Congress and the FCC<br/><b>WHEN: </b>Tues., Feb. 24, 11:30 a.m. EST<br/><b>CALL-IN NUMBERS: </b>877-876-9175 or 785-424-1668<br/><b>WHO: </b>Craig
