<p id="docs-internal-guid-11681670-0d75-b8c6-715c-a33064021488"><span>We’ll keep this brief. Comcast is in attack mode, right now. We need you to fight back.</span></p>
<p><span>Team Cable’s allies in Congress are advancing two bills that would overrule the FCC and kill our dream for real net neutrality [1]. </span><span>Hearings are happening TODAY, at this very moment.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Click here to call the committee members, right now and tell them to stop standing in the way of real net neutrality. We need *everyone* to do this.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This was Comcast’s big play all along: if they lose the FCC, get Congress to do the dirty work. Now it’s happening. There are two </span><span>fake</span><span> net neutrality bills in motion that </span><span>wouldn’t</span><span> stop cable companies from discriminating against certain sites, but </span><span>would</span><span> block the FCC from enforcing real rules.</span></p>
<p><span>Hearings run all day. The House hearings start at 10am, and the Senate at 2pm.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">How awesome would it be if while they’re at these bogus hearings, they get panicked texts from staff about the HUGE number of pro-net neutrality calls? That’s what we’re shooting for. Can you call now?</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, since there’s really a lot of calls to make, we’re trying something special. if you call all 10 targets, the 11th call goes to my personal cell phone, where I’ll thank you personally. </span></p>
<p><span>Will you do it? If so, talk to you soon! :)</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>Holmes Wilson (and the entire team)<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S.</span><span> If you’re interested, we’re live streaming the hearings at </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">battleforthenet.com</a></strong><span> all day. Watch them, and dig in on Twitter.</span></p>
