Everyone knows that the tides have turned. Even opponents of net neutrality and free speech are finally admitting defeat as the FCC prepares to vote on rules that–just one year ago–were thought to be completely impossible. DC insiders, lobbyists, and pundits would do well to take the word “impossible” out of their vocabulary. When Internet users learn that the free and open Web is being threatened, they’ll stop at nothing to defend it, and when the Internet comes together to fight, nothing is impossible.”</p><p>Greer and Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng will be available for interviews at the following events in Washington, DC on Thursday, February 26th:</p><p><b>WHAT:</b> <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/335073503365548" target="_blank">Victory for the Net: Rally at the FCC</a></b><br/><b>WHEN:</b> Thursday, Feb 26th, 8:15am<br/><b>WHERE:</b> FCC Headquarters, 445 12th St SW<br/><b>VISUALS:</b> Marching band, net neutrality supporters dancing and celebrating with signs and banners outside FCC building ahead of historic vote</p><p><br/></p><p><b>WHAT:</b> <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1591300681081651" target="_blank">Victory for the Net: Party</a></b><br/><b>WHEN:</b> Thursday, Feb 26th, 6:30pm<br/><b>WHERE:</b> Lost Society, 2001 14th St NW<br/><b>VISUALS:</b> Net neutrality supporters celebrating in an indoor bar venue, speakers including Nancy Pelosi and activists from a wide range of activist groups that were instrumental in securing net neutrality</p><p><br/></p><p>To schedule an interview, call Evan Greer at 978-852-6457 or email press@fightforthefuture.org <br/></p><p>Additionally, Fight for the Future is working with many other groups to support the <b><a href="http://stoptheslowlane.net" target="_blank">#InternetCountdown JUMBOTRON</a></b>, a giant video-billboard streaming net neutrality messages from thousands of Internet users, which will be parked directly outside FCC Headquarters today, Wednesday, Feb 25th.</p><p>###</p>
