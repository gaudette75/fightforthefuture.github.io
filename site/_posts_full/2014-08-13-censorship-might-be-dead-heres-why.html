<p id="docs-internal-guid-76936339-d060-65ba-8ac6-4fa4ba03cca2"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>Imagine how awful it would be if your favorite websites were blocked by your government. And if, no matter how tech-savvy you were, every tool or trick you used to escape censorship was blocked in a matter of months.</span></p>
<p><span>That&rsquo;s what life is like for China&rsquo;s entire population of 1.3 billion people. In the country that produces 90% of the world&rsquo;s smartphones, you can’t even reach YouTube – and the government shuts down anti-censorship tools as soon as they become popular.</span></p>
<p><span>But now, there&rsquo;s a new hope in the fight against censors: Lantern.</span></p>
<p><span>Lantern is an app that anyone can run to fight censorship. When you run it, you join a global network: If your Internet is uncensored, you *give* uncensored access to others. If your Internet is censored, you can *get* uncensored access via someone else.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://getlantern.org/" target="_blank"><span>Can you take one step right now that will help thousands break free from Internet censorship? Download and install Lantern!</span></a></p>
<p><span>Lantern’s features make it really hard to block. It disguises its traffic and bounces it through popular, costly-to-censor services. It also builds a giant cloud of volunteer proxies, using a &ldquo;six degrees of separation&rdquo; trick to find friends of friends to proxy through, increasing the number of internet addresses involved and making it impractical for censors to block every one. </span><span>But to make this work, we need thousands of people (you!) to download Lantern and run it.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes the Internet wins by banding together as a community. Sometimes we win through clever technical tricks. This time, the problem requires both: we need to come together around tools like this to get a victory.</span></p>
<p><span>Lantern is</span><a href="https://getlantern.org/" target="_blank"><span> free, open source, and just takes a minute. Can you install Lantern and help beat China&rsquo;s censors?</span></a></p>
<p><span>Once you install it, you forget it&rsquo;s there. I&rsquo;ve been running Lantern for months now with no issues. Please do install it now!</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span>Holmes Wilson</span></p>
