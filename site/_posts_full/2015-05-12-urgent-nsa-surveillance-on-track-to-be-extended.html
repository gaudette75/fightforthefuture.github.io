On May 7th, 2015, the Second District Court of Appeals
ruled that the NSA&rsquo;s bulk collection of phone call data using Section 215 of the Patriot
Act, as revealed by Edward Snowden,
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html?_r=0" target="_blank">
is illegal</a><b>.</b> <br/></p><p>This decision, if upheld, would end the NSA&rsquo;s capability
to suck up bulk phone call data.
</p><p>
Now Congress is trying to pass a bill—
the Orwellian “USA Freedom Act”—that would give this power back to the NSA through
new legal loopholes while appearing on the surface to reign-in the NSA. <br/></p><p>The bill is getting voted on <a href="http://www.majorityleader.gov/floor/" target="_blank">this week</a>.
Don&rsquo;t be fooled. It is designed to appease the public while cementing
the government&rsquo;s surveillance authority for years to come. <br/></p><h2>USA Freedom Act doesn&rsquo;t just fail to reform mass surveillance; it extends and expands it.</h2><ul><li>

Extends Section 215 of the Patriot Act until 2019</a> while modernizing
it so it can suck up more information on the devices we use most commonly.

The bill expands
call data from landlines to include VoIP calls and video chats, and likely will allow
the government to access all data related to smartphone activity.

Claims to end bulk collection, but would allow the government to continue collecting huge amounts of data

anyone who is &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to those targets.

“emergency” powers</a> for the government to collect all kinds

Allows the FBI to access data collected for counterterrorism investigations

can then set up <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2048/text/ih#link=V_502_a&amp;nearest=HF9FAE778A410456F8A766DBF747B4985" target="_blank">

they choose to keep secret from them.

Takes wind out of the sails of real reform by appearing to have addressed
mass surveillance (without actually doing anything to fundamentally alter
mass surveillance).
