He went on to express that he has privacy concerns about data collection “across the board” but reiterated “I have not examined that particular bill.”</p><p>Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng had this to say in response to the video, “Ted Cruz’s confused response about CISA underscores the fact that Congress has no clue what they are voting on, and even less of a clue how to actually address critical cybersecurity issues. Security experts, tech companies who actually deal with cyber attacks, and privacy advocates all agree this bill is not only flawed but dangerous. I sincerely hope that Ted Cruz and the rest of Congress can take some time out of their busy campaigning schedules to actually read this bill before they vote on it.”</p><p>Feel free to reach out to us for more.
