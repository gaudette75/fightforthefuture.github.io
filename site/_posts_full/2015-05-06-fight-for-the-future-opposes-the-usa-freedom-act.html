<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 5, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p><h2>Fight for the Future opposes the USA Freedom Act; calls for end to all mass government surveillance</h2><p><i>So-called “reform bill is intended to enshrine modern surveillance state into law</i></p><p>Fight for the Future, a digital rights group with more than 1.4 million members that has been at the forefront of the fight against mass surveillance and organized the <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank"><b>Reset the Net</b></a> campaign endorsed by <b><a href="http://resetthenet.tumblr.com/post/87793640365/edward-snowdens-statement-in-support-of-reset-the" target="_blank">Edward Snowden</a> </b>and thousands of major tech companies, strongly opposes the USA Freedom Act, dangerous legislation that fails to end mass government surveillance and in fact codifies some of the worst practices into law.</p><p>Congress should not consider any legislation that reauthorizes Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Instead, Congress should let this dangerous provision expire and pass much-needed reforms, including ending mass surveillance under section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, Executive Order 12333 and other authorities, and enhancing Congressional oversight of secret intelligence agencies.</p><p><b>Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng said,</b> “No expert would disagree &ndash; the USAFreedom Act does not end bulk collection. This bill looks like it was crafted at the behest of intelligence agencies seeking to maintain the status quo and contains a series of loopholes that seem to negate every reform the bill purports to make. At a time when the public is outraged that Congress has done nothing to rein in abusive government spying, we should not enshrine the modern surveillance state into law under the guise of meager reform.”</p><p>“The USA Freedom Act is an insult to the millions of people around the world who have spoken out online and taken to the streets demanding that the U.S. government respect their human right to privacy,” <b>added FFTF’s Campaign Director, Evan Greer,</b> “Freedom cannot exist in a world where everyone is constantly looking over their shoulder, wondering if their government is watching. The USAFreedom Act is an abuse of the word “freedom” and organizations and lawmakers who truly support liberty and freedom of speech will oppose it.”</p><p>Fight for the Future representatives are available for comment on the USA Freedom Act and other surveillance and internet freedom issues.
