<p><strong>So much to tell! So little time.</strong></p>
<p><span>In just two days, we will Reset the Net and take the first steps toward blocking illegitimate government surveillance from the web. Momentum is growing &ndash; just today Google, Mozilla, CloudFlare, and dozens of other major sites announced they’ll be joining our effort to secure the web. </span></p>
<p><span>And</span><span>, we got word of an extra exciting announcement coming from Edward Snowden himself. </span></p>
<p><span>More on that soon. Here’s what you can do to help us keep up the momentum right now:</span></p>
