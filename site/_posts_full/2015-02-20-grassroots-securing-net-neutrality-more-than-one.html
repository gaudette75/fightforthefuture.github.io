<p><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>February 18, 2015</b></p><p><b>Grassroots Securing Net Neutrality: More Than One Million Calls, Emails to Congress &amp; FCC in 2015</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><i>The numbers send a clear message in support of an open internet to Congress and FCC in advance of Feb. 26 vote</i></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>WASHINGTON, DC</b> – People across the country are taking a strong stand for net neutrality, and
 have generated more than one million actions in  just the first seven 
weeks of 2015. In large numbers, they are emailing, calling, and signing
 petitions to their lawmakers and the FCC. These grassroots actions are 
in addition to the four million comments submitted
 to the FCC in 2014. The massive show of support stands in stark 
contrast to the lobbying and advertising campaigns financed by cable 
giants like Comcast and trade associations like NCTA.
</p><p>A
 diverse coalition of net neutrality supporters— including Color of 
Change, CREDO, Daily Kos, Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, Free 
Press,
<a href="http://MoveOn.org" target="_blank">MoveOn.org</a>, and Mozilla—announced the new numbers today and released the following statement:</p><p>“More
 than one million people have stood up for net neutrality in the last 
seven weeks, which shows how deeply engaged the public is with this 
issue. The public overwhelmingly
 rejects internet fast lanes for the rich and slow lanes for the rest of
 us. 
</p><p>“Congress
 should follow the will of the people and stop trying to interfere with 
the FCC. Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T and NCTA should stop pouring money 
into Congress, false
 ads and lobbyists in their last ditch attempt to undermine the public 
will.”</p><p>A breakdown of the numbers released on today’s call is below:</p><p><b>TOTAL January 1 – February 18, 2015: 1,023,296</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Emails &amp; Petitions to Congress: 716,950</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Calls to Congress: 120,710</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Emails &amp; Petitions to FCC: 75,834</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Emails &amp; Petitions to Others (NCTA, CTIA): 109,802</b></p><p>###</p>
