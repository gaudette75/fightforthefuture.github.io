<p id="docs-internal-guid-d7064dcd-a42d-9c28-74fe-50a297fed193"><span>Hey,</span></p>
<p><span>Today we are asking everyone to take </span><span>urgent action</span><span> to tell President Barack Obama to keep his campaign promises and immediately take steps to protect net neutrality. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/obama" target="_blank">Will you sign the petition telling President Obama to keep his word? Click here.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Here’s the latest: Fight for the Future’s co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng is on her way to the White House </span><span>right now</span><span>. She’s been invited to take part in a conversation about net neutrality, in response to a letter we sent with many other groups calling on the White House to endorse Title II reclassification (aka </span><span>real</span><span> net neutrality).</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Tiffiniy is there for one thing: </span><span>to tell Obama’s staff point blank that it’s time for the President to do his job and make good on the many promises he made during his campaign.</span><span> Candidate Obama said he would “take a backseat to no one” in defense of net neutrality and that he would ensure that commissioners he appointed to the FCC would act accordingly.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/obama" target="_blank">But so far, that has all been empty talk. Click here to tell President Obama to keep his promise to keep the Internet free.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The situation couldn’t be more urgent. We just heard from a close friend in DC that after the Internet Slowdown Cable company lobbyists descended in droves and have been tag teaming the FCC and members of Congress, making veiled threats and calling net neutrality supporters “extremists.”</span></p>
<p><span>Obama keeps saying that the FCC is an independent agency and his hands are tied, but that’s simply not true. Obama has the power to demote Tom Wheeler (the telecom lobbyist that he appointed as the head of the FCC) and promote an FCC commissioner who will actually do their job and stand up to companies like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon for the public good.</span></p>
