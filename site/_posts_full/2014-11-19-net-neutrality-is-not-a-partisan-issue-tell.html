<p id="docs-internal-guid-33f34d3c-c930-9d16-ec01-0c6cf83982bb"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Signature needed: Tell Congress you’re not fooled by Comcast’s lies.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Net neutrality is not a partisan issue. Since the Internet was built it’s been based on a few basic principles: like the idea that everyone’s data should move at the same speed, and no government or corporation should interfere or decide what you can see and do online.</span></p>
<p><strong>That’s not a liberal or conservative idea. It’s just a good idea. </strong><span>Everyone from venture capitalists to environmentalists support it. [1]</span></p>
<p><span>But now that we’re potentially days away from getting a rule to prevent Cable company F*$kery, monopolies like Comcast and Verizon are doubling down on manipulating the process: they’re calling in all their favors in Congress by tapping the offices of everyone they donated to. [2] And, it&rsquo;s working. </span></p>
<p><span>Despite net neutrality being obvious policy, their pals in Congress are working to screw things up again by making this into a partisan circus, and unleashing Cable propaganda. All to take focus away from the facts: the Internet has thrived with net neutrality for 20 years, and we need to keep the net neutral to keep it awesome.</span></p>

<p><span>Fortunately, the public isn’t fooled. We know that net neutrality is not “regulating the Internet.” It’s just ground rules that PREVENT mega-corporations like Comcast </span><span>and </span><span>governments from regulating the Internet in their own interest.</span></p>
<p><span>This Friday is the last day for the FCC to come out with a proposal for full Title II reclassification. If they don’t, part of the blame rests with Congress, who have been muddying the waters on this issue even though there is a clear public consensus.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Sign the petition to your lawmakers: tell them you’re not fooled by lies or partisan politics and you want them to support real net neutrality.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’re close. Really close. But this fight is going to get uglier before we win. FOIA&rsquo;d documents that were just released show just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and just how cozy the relationship between the FCC and the telecoms really is. [3] Stay vigilant. Check your facts. Don’t believe everything you read on the Internet and DEFINITELY don’t believe what you see on Cable TV. </span></p>
<p><span>We’ve come this far &ndash; we’ve taken Title II reclassification from something that was impossible to something that now seems nearly inevitable. We’re ready to take it home and we’re proud to have you on the team.</span></p>
