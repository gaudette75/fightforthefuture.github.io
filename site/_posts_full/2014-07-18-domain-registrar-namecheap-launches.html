<p id="docs-internal-guid-0b499e91-4b21-9795-52c7-1f7523575a65"><strong>Leading domain registrar Namecheap strikes hard for open internet through reclassification with launch of NetNeutrality.com</strong></p>
<p><em>Company that supports more than three million domain names says lasting net neutrality is essential to the Internet economy, encourages customers to submit comments to FCC before midnight deadline</em></p>
<p><span>With 12 hours to go before the new deadline that closes the first round of comments in the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality proceeding, leading domain registrar Namecheap swooped in to strike hard on the side of an open Internet by launching </span><a href="http://netneutrality.com" target="_blank"><span>NetNeutrality.com</span></a><span>, an action site encouraging Internet users to continue bombarding the FCC with comments in support of Title II reclassification to protect the Internet in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC extended the original Wednesday comment deadline after various grassroots advocacy efforts like Fight for the Future’s BattleForTheNet.com action site flooded the FCC site with comments, causing it to go offline. As of Thursday July 17th, the FCC has received 1,030,000 comments, according to Gigi Sohn, Special Counsel for External Affairs for the FCC. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Over one million people depend on Namecheap to power their websites&rdquo; said Richard Kirkendall, Namecheap’s CEO and Founder, &ldquo;We have a moral responsibility to do everything we can as a company to defend the free and open Internet, ensuring that every single one of our customers can make their voice heard.”</span></p>
<p><span>“This is a crucial moment where we need every single voice raised demanding real net neutrality through Title II reclassification,” said Evan Greer, Campaign Manager at Fight for the Future. “Net neutrality is the free speech fight of our generation. It’s great to see so many voices, from huge sites to tiny blogs lining up to stand on Team Internet against any form of censorship online.”</span></p>
