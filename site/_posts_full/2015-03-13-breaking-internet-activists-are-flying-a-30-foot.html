Don’t betray us! Save the Internet. No Fast Track for the TPP.”</b> The banner also features popular Internet “memes” like Grumpy Cat, and a reference to the massive online protests against SOPA, a bill that Senator Wyden opposed.</p><p>The blimp action is being organized by <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, a digital rights nonprofit best known for their vibrant online campaigns that have mobilized millions of people to take action for net neutrality, online privacy, and free speech.</p><p>The 30-foot blimp will be flying outside all of Senator Wyden’s Town Hall meetings in the following locations. There will be excellent opportunities for photos and visuals on site, and Fight for the Future will have high resolution photos and videos available for use by the media after the event.</p><h2><b>Friday, March 13th</b></h2><p><b>UMATILLA, OR: 10:30am <br/></b>Clara Brownell Middle School (1300 7th St)<br/><b>LA GRANDE, OR: 5:00pm<br/></b>Union County Senior Center (1504 N Albany St)</p><h2><b>Saturday, March 14th</b></h2><p><b>BAKER CITY, OR: 10:00am<br/></b>Baker County Senior Center (2810 Cedar St)<br/><b>ONTARIO, OR: 3:30pm<br/></b>Four Rivers Cultural Center (676 SW 5th Ave)</p><p>Fight for the Future campaign director Evan Greer said, “Senator Wyden has been a strong supporter of Internet freedom issues during his entire career. We are shocked that he is considering supporting anti-democratic Fast Track legislation that would allow the future of the Internet to be decided behind closed doors. We are flying this blimp across Oregon because Senator Wyden needs to know that the Internet is depending on him, and where he stands on this issue will decide whether he is remembered as a hero or a traitor.”</p><p>To request an interview with one of the organizers or to request photos and video of the protest, please email <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> or call 978-852-6457.</p><p>###</p>
