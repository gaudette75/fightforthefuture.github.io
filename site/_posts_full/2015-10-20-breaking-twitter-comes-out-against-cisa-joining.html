<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 20, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>Twitter is the latest major tech company to join the rising wave of opposition to CISA, a deeply controversial cybersecurity bill that could hit the Senate floor as early as today.<br/></p><p>The company, which has 316 million active users worldwide, <a href="https://twitter.com/policy/status/656288688364609536" target="_blank">tweeted it’s opposition</a> to CISA from it’s official policy account early this morning, saying: “Security + privacy are both priorities for us and therefor we can’t support #CISA as written. We hope to see positive changes going forward.”</p><p>Twitter is joining a growing chorus of major technology companies that have recently come out strongly against the latest version of CISA, echoing concerns from security experts and privacy advocates that CISA would fail to prevent cyber attacks while dramatically expanding government surveillance and undermining user privacy. </p><p>Over the weekend <a href="https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/655938689952976896" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/654714193040400384" target="_blank">reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wikimediapolicy/status/655179547994816512" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> weighed in against CISA. Last week, CCIA, an industry association representing tech giants Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon, Sprint, and others, also <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131222608488/breaking-trade-group-representing-google" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> slamming the bill. Mozilla, imgur, Wordpress, Craigslist, Namecheap, and hundreds of other companies have opposed CISA and similar information sharing legislation in the past.</p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies, clarified that <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">it does not support</a> any of the three information sharing bills before Congress after Fight for the Future ran <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">a public campaign</a> called YouBetrayedUs that spurred a flurry of angry emails from consumers targeting companies that signed a BSA letter that appeared to support CISA. </p><p>CISA’s sponsors have repeatedly claimed that the bill will see the senate floor this week, but given this latest revolt from the tech industry, many watching the bill are skeptical of it moving quickly anytime soon.</p><p>###</p>
