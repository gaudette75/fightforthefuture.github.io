<h2><i>Apple is the latest major tech company to come out opposing the controversial bill, which would undermine user privacy without improving security</i></h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 21, 2015</p><p>Contact: Holmes Wilson, 614-465-6371, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Just days before a critical vote, Apple has become the latest major tech company to voice their opposition to CISA, a so-called cybersecurity bill that experts say would undermine user privacy while utterly failing to improve cybersecurity.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support the current CISA proposal,&rdquo; Apple <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/10/20/apple-says-its-against-a-key-cybersecurity-bill-days-before-a-crucial-vote/?ooiuoiuer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> to the Washington Post, &ldquo;The trust of our customers means everything to us and we don&rsquo;t believe security should come at the expense of their privacy.&rdquo;</p><p>“Apple gets privacy and security better than most companies, and way better than Congress does,” said Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng, “Our lawmakers’ lack of understanding of cybersecurity isn’t just embarrassing, it’s dangerous. They should listen to the experts and abandon this hopelessly flawed bill.”</p><p>Apple’s statement is the latest in what can only be described as a revolt by the tech industry who now nearly unanimously oppose the bill.
