<p id="docs-internal-guid-186a4ad0-0737-2a73-6049-b13d980a2b44"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">Urgent: vote coming soon on the TPP Internet censorship plan. Click here to speak out.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The U.S. Trade Representative has confirmed that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is moving again, with  confidential meetings in Washington, DC next week. TPP-defenders in Congress have already been making noise about a Fast Track vote, and this could be a sign that it’s coming soon. </span></p>
<p><span>Just last month, the latest version of the TPP’s crucial copyright &amp; intellectual property chapter was leaked, and the news was not good. </span><span>The Internet censorship provisions in the </span><span>TPP have gotten even worse. </span><span>[1]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">Don’t let governments censor the net. Take action now to stop Fast Track for the TPP.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’ve beaten the TPP back before. It’s time to do it again. While these secret meetings are being pushed by the White House, corrupt officials in Congress want to “fast track” the TPP right now during the lame duck session. [2] The vote could be close. Will you take action now to stop Internet censorship?</span></p>

<p><span>Millions of people have already spoken out against the TPP power grab. Every issue we care about depends on the future of the free and open web. Take a moment today to defend it.</span></p>
