<p><span>Hey there, </span></p>
<p><span>Got two seconds to help? </span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/disconnectvote" target="_blank">Please vote for Fight for the Future for Disconnect’s charity of the month!</a><br/><br/></strong><span>Exciting news! The Fight for the Future community is growing.</span><span> We now have more than 1 million members who are spread out all over the world</span><span>, and come from nearly every political viewpoint. Our love for the free and open Internet unites us.<br/><br/>While we’ve been growing our ranks, we’ve been keeping our team small and our costs low. There’s still just six of us running FFTF with the help of an amazing network of volunteers, coalition partners, and co-conspirators.</span></p>
<p><span>Many of you have funded our work. We&rsquo;ve been excited to report how we use our resources creatively &ndash; we go big or go home. </span><span>Just this year we:</span><span><br/></span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>occupied the FCC building for 10 days</span></a><span>, putting Title II net neutrality on the map and drawing international headlines, and then we launched Battleforthenet.com and broke the FCC’s website with a deluge of comments <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">just before the deadline.</a></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>organized </span><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><span>Reset the Net</span></a><span>, the <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank">largest effort yet </a></span><span>to shut down mass surveillance with technology. The campaign was endorsed </span><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/87856695073/a-message-from-edward-snowden-on-the-eve-of-reset-the" target="_blank"><span>by Edward Snowden</span></a><span> and reached billions of people.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>began development on an open source app and browser extension (that many of you helped fund!) that will allow us to send urgent alerts without using email when the Internet is threatened. Want to help? <a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/TeamFutureForFirefox" target="_blank">Check out the code on github</a> and get involved.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li><span>brought together an <a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">unprecedented coalition</a> of tech companies, labor unions, environmental groups, leftists and libertarians to oppose Fast Track and the Trans Pacific Partnership’s secretive internet censorship plan.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>won the prestigious </span><a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/6/23/19-projects-win-knight-news-challenge-strengthening-internet/" target="_blank"><span>Knight Foundation&rsquo;s prototype award</span></a><span> to build a global anti-censorship alert system. Helped crowdfund thousands of VPNs to send to activists fighting censorship in Turkey.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>pushed back on the expansion of corporate meddling in Internet freedom by rallying </span><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>against CISA </span></a><span>(the new CISPA), collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures against Facebook’s </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/facebookopt-out/" target="_blank"><span>abusive practices</span></a><span>, and <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/89888291608/net-neutrality-protesters-arrested-late-last-night-at" target="_blank">supporting Occupy Google</a></span><span> when they were arrested for free speech.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>Here’s a super easy way you can help us keep winning victories like these:</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/disconnectvote" target="_blank">Click here to vote for Fight for the Future for Disconnect’s charity of the month!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>It doesn’t cost anything, so it’s an awesome way to help even if you’re broke! You don’t have to log in or share your email or anything. It takes two seconds and it could help us receive thousands of dollars of much needed funding that we’ll immediately use to continue ramping up the fight for net neutrality, online privacy, and free expression.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re so proud of what we’ve accomplished together! All 1,247,000 (and counting) of us. Just as a reminder, we only want to email people who want to get our emails, so if you ever want to unsubscribe, we try to make it really easy. Just use the link at the bottom of all our emails.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for being part of the Fight for the Future team. Feels good to win, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span>With respect,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, Jessica, Jeff<br/>and the whole FFTF team</span></p>
