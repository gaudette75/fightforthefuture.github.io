<p id="docs-internal-guid-4db8be82-57e1-c5c7-fbb7-a367cb22927c"><span>Hey,</span></p>
<p><span>No time to write. There are 30 hours left until the Internet Slowdown protest for net neutrality, and all of us here at FFTF are working round the clock to make this huge.</span></p>
<p><span>Everything you need is right here: </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Just this morning, Netflix announced that they’re joining the slowdown and will be showing a prominent message sitewide on September 10th. That’s huge.  We’re going to reach millions and millions of people who have never heard the words “net neutrality” before. So many of you have already joined and have been helping spread the word, and we can’t thank you enough.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the thing. </span><span>It’s not enough for this protest to be huge. It has to be massive.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Time Warner are spending more than $1 million per week lobbying to make sure that the FCC protects </span><span>their </span><span>interests even though the public’s voice couldn&rsquo;t be clearer. </span><span>It’s possible to drown out the influence of those lobbying dollars &ndash; we’ve proven that before &ndash;  but only if everyone starts scrambling right now to get even more people and sites on board.</span></p>
<p><span>Will you forward this email to everyone you know right now? Another way to help is to text everyone in your address book this link: </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th</a></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>We need to get the slowdown trending and viral on social media starting TONIGHT. Use these links to share on social media. </span><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/509129530586701824/photo/1" target="_blank">Retweet this awesome gif </a>or make your own and tweet to #InternetSlowdown.</strong></p>
