<p>Hey team,</p>
<p>My fingers are trembling a bit as I type this email — partly from exhaustion but mostly from tremendous excitement. <strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Tomorrow we Reset the Net, and start on a path toward securing the web, and defending freedom for generations to come</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Just today, we received a very special message from Edward Snowden himself. All of us at Fight for the Future are humbled, knowing that our huge victories this year mobilizing against government surveillance would not have been possible without him risking everything to expose the abuses of the worlds’ most powerful governments.</p>
<p>I’m pasting Snowden’s statement in its entirety below. Please forward this email to everyone in your address book, and share this far and wide. These last few hours are critical and we need all hands on deck to push Reset the Net over the edge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org/#splash-screen" target="_blank">Edward Snowden started this, now it’s our turn to be heroes. Proudly display these badges on your sites or social media. You’ll be helping protect everyone who sees your part of the web. </a></strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;One year ago, we learned that the internet is under surveillance, and our activities are being monitored to create permanent records of our private lives — no matter how innocent or ordinary those lives might be.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, we can begin the work of effectively shutting down the collection of our online communications, even if the US Congress fails to do the same. That’s why I’m asking you to join me on June 5th for Reset the Net, when people and companies all over the world will come together to implement the technological solutions that can put an end to the mass surveillance programs of any government. This is the beginning of a moment where we the people begin to protect our universal human rights with the laws of nature rather than the laws of nations.</em></p>
<p><em>We have the technology, and adopting encryption is the first effective step that everyone can take to end mass surveillance. That’s why I am excited for Reset the Net — it will mark the moment when we turn political expression into practical action, and protect ourselves on a large scale.</em></p>
<p><em>Join us on June 5th, and don’t ask for your privacy. Take it back.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Will you stand with Edward Snowden, Fight for the Future, and the largest websites on the Internet to help Reset the Net tomorrow, June 5th?</strong><br/><br/>Please help spread the word by sharing the page on social media:</p>
