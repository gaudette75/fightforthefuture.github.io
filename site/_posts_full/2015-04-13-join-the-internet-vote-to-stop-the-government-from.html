Sign up here.</b></a></p><p>Dear Fight for the Future member,</p><p>If you feel like every week there’s is always another looming threat to the future of free speech on the Internet, it’s because there is.</p><p>The root of the problem is that too many decisions that impact Internet freedom are made by government bureaucrats and corporate lobbyists behind closed doors and without public input.</p><p>Right now, U.S. Congress is planning to pass a “Fast Track” bill that will make this situation even worse by ramming through secret agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that could lead to more censorship and less privacy online. We think Internet users should have a voice anytime there’s a major decision that impacts our rights.</p><p><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/internetvote/" target="_blank"><b>So we’re organizing an Internet-wide vote on April 23rd to stop “Fast Track” and give Internet users a voice. Will you join?</b></a></p><p>This is that do-or-die moment. But if we win, it won’t just slow down the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it will send a message to those in power that they can’t mess with the Internet. Ever.</p><p>The parties are split on Fast Track &ndash; which means if we as Internet users weigh in en masse, we can tip the scales and stop Fast Track for good.</p><p><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank"><b>Are you in?

Let’s not let that happen.</p><p>Yours for Team Internet,<br/>-Evan at FFTF</p><p>P.S.
