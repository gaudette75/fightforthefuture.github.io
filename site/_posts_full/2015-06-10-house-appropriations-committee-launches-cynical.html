<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>June 10, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p><h2><i>The appropriations process is being used by a captured Congress to undermine Open Internet Rules that nearly 4 million Americans fought to pass.</i></h2><p>On Wednesday, June 10, 2015, the House introduced no less than three amendments to a must-pass appropriations bill that, through different mechanisms, would block the FCC from enforcing its Open Internet (“Net Neutrality”) Rules. By attaching these amendments to a must-pass bill, Congress has made them difficult for President Obama (who supports Open Internet rules) to veto.</p><p>Each amendment, if passed, would severely undermine the FCC’s ability to stop cable companies from blocking, throttling, or discriminating against specific websites for arbitrary, non-technical reasons.</p><p>“Congress doesn’t get it. Millions of Americans fought for net neutrality, and they won,” <b>said Fight for the Future campaign director Evan Greer, </b>“It’s time for the cable companies to stop looking for favors from Washington and actually focus on providing the thing their customers want: faster, more reliable service.”</p><p>“These FCC rules are the Internet’s last line of defense from the one threat it can’t simply out-innovate: being throttled by companies like Comcast who have millions of American households locked in,” <b>said Fight for the Future co-director Holmes Wilson, </b>“Here you see Congress jumping through ridiculous procedural hoops, just to kill the most vibrant part of our economy: Internet-enabled small business.”</p><p>“It’s almost sad how unsurprising this kind of underhanded sneak attack is coming from cable companies and their friends in Congress,&ldquo; <b>said Fight for the Future Campaign Manager Charlie Furman.</b> &quot;People overwhelmingly support Net Neutrality, so of course cable companies bury their attacks a hundred pages deep in an appropriations bill the public doesn&rsquo;t read closely.&rdquo;</p><p>###</p>
