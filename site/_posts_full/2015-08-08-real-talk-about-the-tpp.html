<p><i>This email is straight from the heart, so I apologize in advance if it’s too brutally honest. I hope you’ll read the whole thing, though, because the fight to stop the TPP affects all of us. <br/></i><br/><i>But, if you’ve only got a second, please<b> <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank">click here to chip in $5 to help us fight the TPP.</a></b></i></p><p><i>With love from the Internet,<br/>~ Evan</i></p><p>Dear Fight for the Future member,</p><p>Here’s the deal: last month, Congress passed “Fast Track” for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p><p><b>That means the TPP is now just one vote away from becoming law.</b></p><p>When Fast Track passed, it was heartbreaking. Over the last two years Fight for the Future built a totally unprecedented coalition of advocacy groups, tech companies, and activists fighting Fast Track, and together we were able to successfully defeat or delay Fast Track FIVE TIMES.</p><p>But in the end, pressure from the White House and an army of entrenched industry lobbyists was too much for Congress to resist, despite the overwhelming public outcry.</p><p>Now, we have a choice. We can just give up, and accept that democracy is over and the TPP is inevitable, or we can take matters into our own hands.</p><p><b>Here at Fight for the Future, we don’t believe in giving up. <br/></b><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank"><b>If you&rsquo;re the same way and want to fight the TPP to the end, click here to chip in $5 to help us stop it.</b></a></p><p>I can speak for myself and say that I personally can’t sleep at night unless I know I’m doing everything in my power to protect our most basic rights online and off.</p><p>Together, we have fought against insurmountable odds before and won — we killed SOPA, stopped CISPA, and just this year we won Net Neutrality. Now, we’re planning to win big again. We don’t care what the DC pundits say – we are going to stop the TPP. But we can’t do it alone.</p><p>Just last week, representatives from all 13 of the nations involved in the TPP met in Hawaii to finalize the deal — and they couldn’t do it. The sticking point? The intellectual property rights chapter where copyright and all of the worst provisions for the Internet are housed.</p><p>That means if anyone can stop the TPP, it’s us. But, to be frank, we are dangerously low on funds to continue fighting the TPP, and we need to do more than just continue. If we’re going to win, we need to take it to the next level.</p><p><b>Can you chip in to help make sure we have the resources to keep fighting and win?</b></p><p><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank"><b>Click here to chip in $5 to take on the TPP!</b></a></p><p>In emails like this, it’s common for groups to spread either doom and gloom or unsubstantiated optimism. I have neither of those for you today, just real talk.</p><p>The TPP is bad. Really bad. It’s arguably one of the worst things that could happen to the Internet, to our economy, and to the planet.</p><p>I can’t promise that we’re going to stop it. But I can promise that if we don’t try, it will certainly pass.</p><p><b>Can you chip in $5 to help us keep up the fight?</b></p><p><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank"><b>Yes, I’ll chip in $5 to help stop the TPP.</b></a></p><p>We plan to fight until the last breath, and we’re honored to have you fighting alongside us.</p><p>For the Internet,<br/>-Evan at Fight for the Future</p><p>P.S. Whether we win or lose on the TPP, the battle for the future of the Internet will rage on. To win these fights in the long run, we need to have consistent, ongoing support from people like you.
