<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>Look, you don’t have time to read a long email, and I don’t have time to write one so I’ll get right to the point:</span><span> we are just $20,000 short of our year-end fundraising goal, and there’s still 48 hours left. </span><span>Can you help us close the gap so we don’t have to scale back our campaigns in the New Year?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=yearend2014version1" target="_blank">Please click here help us keep winning in 2015.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>2014 was an amazing year for Fight for the Future. T</span><span>hank you so much for being part of our growing movement to defend free speech in the digital age. </span><span>We’ve accomplished more together than any of the pundits or lobbyists thought was possible at this time last year and we should all be proud! </span></p>
<p><span>2015 will be critical year in the battle over the future of the Internet. </span><span>We’re doing the math right now and we know if we start off the New Year low on funds, we’re going to have to make tough choices about what to work on.</span><span> The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revival of CISPA, net neutrality, the MPAA’s latest attempt at SOPA, our ongoing work to end mass surveillance. Every single one of these campaigns is essential to the future of the web. Failure is not an option. </span><span>That’s why we’re asking for your help again.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=yearend2014version1" target="_blank">There’s still time! Please chip in to help us meet our goal and hit the ground running in the new year.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>I know we can do this</span><span>. Whether you can afford to chip in $3 or $3,000, we will make every penny of your donation count.</span><span> We are a tiny team. We all work from home on our laptops. We don’t have a big fancy office or any real overhead. We use every dollar that comes our way to fight as hard as we can to keep the Internet free and open. So many of you have given generously already and we thank you. If you can afford to chip in a few dollars more, it will really make a difference. If you can’t give this year, we totally understand. Thank you for being part of the team.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=yearend2014version1" target="_blank">Last chance. If you can, please click here to donate to support our work.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Happy new year! Celebrate hard and stay safe!</span></p>
