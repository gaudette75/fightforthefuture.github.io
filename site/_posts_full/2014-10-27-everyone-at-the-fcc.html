<p><span><strong>Net Neutrality was just called “inevitable” by Communication Daily</strong>, the telecom industry trade press for cable insiders.<br/><br/><a href="http://callthefcc.com" id="docs-internal-guid-7f77b763-3dbe-ea2c-a789-4b9cd97f0e75" target="_blank"><span>Click here to take action to demand that the FCC enforce net neutrality!</span></a><br/><br/>Less than a year ago, Title II net neutrality was thought to be impossible. But the tides have changed in Washington because of how hard we’ve fought for net neutrality. Now, it&rsquo;s clear we need to make sure everyone at the FCC has a reason to stand up for the public interest and help save net neutrality for good.<br/><br/></span><span>That’s why we’re unveiling a new website that will allow you to </span><span>call a randomly selected top official at the FCC to demand real Title II net neutrality every day until the they announce their decision. <br/><br/></span><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>Take action to demand that the FCC save the open Internet!</span></a><br/><br/></p>
<p><span>Big cable might have the money to send in their lobbyists to strike upon Washington - but we have the entire Internet. </span><span>If enough dedicated Internet defenders can step up and call as much of the FCC from now until they make their decision, we can win this battle.</span></p>

<p><span>We took something that seemed impossible &ndash; getting net neutrality from the FCC &ndash; and made so much progress that </span><span>Communication Daily</span><span> is now calling it &ldquo;inevitable.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve accomplished the impossible together before &ndash; killing SOPA </span><span>&amp; </span><span>derailing CISPA. The Internet can do incredible things if we band together and take smart, strategic actions to move the needle. </span><span>Will you call the FCC with us?</span></p>

<p><a href="http://callthefcc.com" id="docs-internal-guid-7f77b763-3dbf-0812-04c9-8635e241793f" target="_blank"><span>“Yes, I’ll take action and demand that the FCC make real Title II net neutrality a reality.”</span></a></p>

<p><span>We’re so close to protecting the open Internet for generations to come, and it was only possible because of the amazing potential of the Internet as a medium for public action. The other side is spending millions to make sure they can control how the Internet works. <span>To even the battlefield, we need to tell all of the FCC that they still have the chance to be a part of Team Internet and defend Title II net neutrality.</span><br/></span></p>

<p><span>P.S. Creating organizing tools like these to contact the FCC uses up a lot of resources. </span><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><span>Will you chip in $5 (or more!) today</span></a><span> to make sure we can keep the pressure on while we have so much momentum?</span></p>
<p><br/><span>P.P.S. Because of our work, the deadline for filing comments on Comcast merger has been delayed indefinitely. You can still send the FCC a note to show them that a Comcast takeover is a terrible thing for the Internet. </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/comcast/" target="_blank"><span>Click here to send your comment to the FCC.</span></a></p>
