We just got word from our allies in DC that U.S. Congress is getting ever closer to cutting a deal to secretively “Fast Track” the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP), a massive trade deal where decisions that affect the global future of the Internet are made behind closed doors. [1]</p><p>We need to act swiftly and strike hard. Will you call Senator Ron Wyden right now and tell him: “Please don’t betray the Internet! No Fast Track for the TPP”</p><p><b>Here’s his number: 202-224-5244</b></p><p><b><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank">Can’t call? Click here to send him an email or tweet at him!</a></b></p><p>We don’t know exactly what’s in the TPP, because the U.S. government has been blocking the release of the text [2], but we do know who has a seat at the table and is helping write the sections on copyright and Internet policy: the MPAA and RIAA. [3] Yep, the same folks that brought us SOPA. </p><p>We also know from leaked versions of the text that the TPP would lead to a more censored, policed, and expensive Internet for everyone, and have all kinds of other side effects on things like access to medicine, online privacy, and even whistleblower protections. [4]</p><p>But there’s good news. One of the key Senators involved with this deal is Ron Wyden, from Oregon. He’s been a strong ally on most Internet freedom issues, and was one of the first politicians to openly oppose SOPA, back before that was the cool thing to do. </p><p>Senator Wyden should be on our side on this issue, but he hasn’t heard from enough Internet users to make him feel like it’s a real Internet freedom issue. We need to change that. And fast. </p><p><b>Call Senator Wyden right now at 202-224-5244 or <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank">Click here to email or tweet him.</a></b></p><p>We are healing a Fast Track bill could be introduced as early as next month. Once that happens, it will be close to impossible to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Our best shot at stopping this thing and saving the Internet is if we can keep Senator Wyden from making that deal in the first place. </p><p>That’s why we’re emailing you today, and that’s why I’m asking you, personally, to PLEASE take action right now. Call Senator Wyden right now to say NO Fast Track for the TPP. </p><p><b>Dial 202-224-5244 or <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank">Click here to email or tweet him through our handy dandy action page.</a></b></p><p>Thanks, Internet!  We’ve proven over and over again that when we fight, we win. Let’s keep it up!<br/></p><p>For the web,<br/>-Evan at FFTF</p><p>P.S. Need a primer on the TPP and what the biggest problems with it are?
