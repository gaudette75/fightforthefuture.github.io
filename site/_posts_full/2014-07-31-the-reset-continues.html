<p><span>Today we’re excited to announce the latest parts of the web that we’re making off-limits to government surveillance as part of our ongoing campaign to Reset the Net.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Have you reclaimed your privacy yet? Click here to get started.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Last month we launched Reset the Net with a bang on and we reached billions of people. The largest websites on earth participated, and we vowed to continue our work to secure the Internet site by site, app by app, and user by user.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the resounding success of Reset the Net and the growing public outcry against mass surveillance, Congress seems intent on dragging their feet and pushing legislation that’s full of loopholes. We at Fight for the Future are disappointed with the latest Senate version of the USA Freedom Act, as it contains vague language that could potentially make things worse than the status quo. We&rsquo;ll be working to demand improvements, but we&rsquo;re not willing to wait.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>By refusing to pass meaningful reform on this issue, the government is giving us no choice but to redouble our efforts to mount a digital self-defense against mass spying.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the awesome news in this month’s Reset the Net announcement:</span></p>
