<p>Get ready to ditch your same-old lunch-hour routine on Sept. 15 and 16— because we need your help to fight FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s plan to allow discrimination online.</p>
<p>We are organizing protests in NYC, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington, DC to defend net neutrality. We need you there! Can you stop by?</p>

<p><strong>BREAKING:</strong> Rally in <strong>Chicago.</strong> Sept 15th. <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_837264987"><span class="aQJ"></span></span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_837264988"><span class="aQJ">Noon-2 PM @ </span></span>Jackson &amp; LaSalle. Heart of the Chicago Financial District. Across the street from the Chicago Federal Reserve. <br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s the details:</p>
<p><strong>Sept. 15</strong> is the <strong><a href="http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_fcc_nprm_oliver/?source=FPblog" target="_blank">deadline for final comments</a> </strong>on Wheeler’s proposal — and while big broadband providers like Comcast are lobbying overtime to push this plan forward, we can’t let them have the last word. To that end we’ve organized big lunchtime rallies in <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/nycprotest" target="_blank"><strong>New York City</strong></a> and <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/phillyprotest" target="_blank"><strong>Philadelphia</strong></a> to save Net Neutrality and fight the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.</p>
<p><strong>On September 16th</strong>, internet freedom supporters will gather at 11:45am at the FCC building <a href="http://freepress.actionkit.com/mailings/view/4945" target="_blank"><strong>in Washington, DC,</strong></a> and our friends <strong><a href="https://www.netneutrality.com/" target="_blank">from Namecheap</a></strong> will be there with a giant video-billboard playing net neutrality videos on a loop! Want your video projected on the billboard? Email it to team@fightforthefuture.org &ndash; Check out Namecheap&rsquo;s awesome video here to get inspiration: <a href="http://NetNeutrality.com" target="_blank">http://NetNeutrality.com</a> </p>
<p>Your voice is essential right now. If you don’t live in DC, New York or Philly, you can organize a rally in your own community. It’s a pretty easy process and we’ve put together a <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/save-internet-event-guide" target="_blank">handy toolkit</a> </strong>with all the info you need to launch your own event.</p>
<p>All of us on #TeamInternet have made a ton of noise since Wheeler proposed his rules — sending <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/07/16/sorry-ms-jackson-net-neutrality-biggest-thing-ever-fcc" target="_blank">record-breaking numbers of comments</a></strong> to the FCC, rallying in <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/05/15/today-day" target="_blank">Washington, D.C.</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/07/24/net-neutrality-activists-take-over-california" target="_blank">California</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/08/29/net-neutrality-activists-take-senate-storm" target="_blank">meeting with our elected officials</a></strong> to push them to stand up for real Net Neutrality.</p>
<p>But we need to keep speaking out to win this one. We’ve got to keep the momentum moving until Wheeler faces facts and realizes that his proposal would kill the open Internet and please no one except mammoth companies like Comcast that want to squash their competition.</p>
<p>So grab your megaphone and get ready to rally on Sept. 15. Let’s make this national day of action one that Net Neutrality haters will never forget.</p>
