<p><strong>Top web companies join Internet Slowdown protest for net neutrality</strong></p>
<p><em>Some of the world’s largest Internet companies &ndash; including Etsy, Kickstarter, Mozilla, reddit, imgur, Foursquare, Vimeo, and Namecheap, Wordpress &ndash; announced today that they will join Internet users and Battle for the Net activists for a creative action on September 10th.</em></p>
<p><span>Today, a chorus of major Internet companies answered </span><strong><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/96549371568/title-ii-advocates-call-for-symbolic-internet" target="_blank">activists’ call</a></strong><span> for a symbolic “Internet Slowdown” protest on September 10th to encourage the FCC to change its current course and take necessary steps to protect net neutrality through Title II reclassification.</span></p>
<p><span>Several top websites &ndash; including Etsy, Kickstarter, Foursquare, Wordpress, Vimeo, reddit, Mozilla, Imgur, Meetup, Cheezburger, Namecheap, Bittorrent, Gandi.net, StartPage, BoingBoing, and Dwolla — announced that they will be joining more than 35 advocacy organizations and hundreds of thousands of activists in a day of action that will give a glimpse into what the Internet might look like if the FCC’s proposed rules go into effect.  The protest comes just 5 days before the FCC’s next comment deadline on September 15th.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>An explanation of the protest, and previews of the Internet Slowdown widgets can be found here: </strong></span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th</a></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Sites participating in the slowdown will display prominent messages that include an infinitely-spinning “site loading” icon &ndash; or the so-called “spinning wheel of death” &ndash; to symbolize what surfing the web could be like without net neutrality. These alerts will direct the sites’ users to call and/or email policymakers in support of net neutrality.  </span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>The names of some of the most well-known companies participating were revealed this morning in a blog post from Engine Advocacy, <strong><a href="http://engine.is/issues/open-internet/speak-up-or-slow-down-why-we-need-a-day-of-action-for-net-neutrality/4508" target="_blank">found here.</a></strong></span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>More companies and other partners will be named in the days leading up to the September 10th protest.</strong></p>

<p><strong>More background:</strong></p>
<p><span>The FCC’s proposal would be a huge boon for the cable companies, and would undermine the Internet as we know it. Under the proposed rules, cable giants like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon would be able to create a two-tiered Internet, with slow lanes (for most of us) and fast lanes (for wealthy corporations that are willing pay fees in exchange for fast service).</span></p>
<p><span>Cable companies would have the power to discriminate against online content and applications — they could pick winners and losers, shake sites down for fees, block content for political reasons, and make it easier for Internet users to view content the cable companies own.</span></p>
<p><span>But the FCC left open the possibility of issuing a stronger rule by reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act and requiring Internet service providers to deliver all content at equal speeds.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC is expected to issue a final rule as soon as the end of the year.</span></p>
