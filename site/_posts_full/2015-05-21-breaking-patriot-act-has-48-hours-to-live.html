These motions on the reauthorization bills will require 60 votes to be approved, and that seems unlikely at this point. If they do somehow get 60 votes, a final vote won’t happen until Wednesday of next week. </p><p>But here’s the thing. All bills have to go through both the Senate and the House of Representatives before they can become law, and the House is leaving for vacation today until after the Patriot Act section expires. The House has already <a href="https://medium.com/@donnydonny/follow-the-money-usa-freedom-act-backers-in-congress-have-taken-more-than-twice-as-much-money-8e1f59d6be61" target="_blank">passed the USA Freedom Act</a>, which renews the Patriot Act, so the only real way for Congress to stop a sunset at this point is for the Senate to pass that bill. </p><p>Our <a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#congress" target="_blank">vote count</a> shows that the Senate doesn’t have the votes to pass it, so if we can prevent a few on-the-fence Senators from siding with the NSA on this, we will be going back to a world where law enforcement and Intelligence officials need to actually get a warrant to spy on us. </p><p>At that point, if Congress wants to bring back the ability for the government to spy on us without a warrant they will need to affirmatively re-legislate the PATRIOT Act. It won’t be just a matter of extending sunset dates anymore. Every member of Congress will have to go down on the record saying they don’t want the government to have to seek a warrant to spy on us, which is a very unpopular position and something that <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/09/64_percent_of_911_legislators.php" target="_blank">2/3rds</a> of the House of Representatives have never had to vote on. </p><p>We are so close to an epic win on mass surveillance. That’s why we’re hosting sunset vigils across the country this evening at senators’ local offices to call on the Patriot Act to expire. <br/></p><p>If you want this win; If you want the government to have to get a warrant before they can spy on you, your communications, and your family, Join us tonight. </p><p><b><a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#protest" target="_blank">Find a local Sunset the Patriot Act vigil here. </a></b></p>
