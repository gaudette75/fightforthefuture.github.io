<p><span>Last year, we were 12 votes shy of defunding the NSA&rsquo;s phone spying program&rsquo;s with a last minute amendment. Now we have a chance for another sneak attack, but we could have less than 24 hours to implement it and push it over the edge. Today or tomorrow, U.S. Congress will vote on an Amendment to the &ldquo;must-pass&rdquo; Defense funding bill that &ndash; if it gets enough yes votes &ndash; could close up the backdoors the NSA has been using to spy on all of us (1).</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">This is a significant silver bullet to disrupt the NSA’s blanket spying. But time is running out. Click here to take action right now!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This Amendment is different. It’s not a big clunky bill that we can expect to get watered down by the corrupt leadership of both parties, it’s more of a Congressional guerilla tactic. Rep. Zoe Lofgren is tacking this Amendment on to the Defense Appropriations Bill, a bill that basically has to pass. She’s forcing the question &ndash; the Amendment basically says that the NSA can’t use any of the funds it’s given to conduct warrantless searches under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and it also prevents them from building back doors into security products (2).</span></p>

<p><strong>Remember the Amash Amendment that no one thought had a chance, and then it almost passed and would have defunded some of the NSA’s programs? (3). </strong><span>If we can flood Congress with calls and emails right now, we can cut off one of the NSA’s octopus arms, and actually stop them from using our own tax dollars to spy on us. </span><strong>The vote could happen as early as this afternoon.</strong></p>

<p><span>We’re busy building the next phase of Reset the Net, our ongoing campaign to rid the Internet of mass surveillance through the massive spread of encryption technology, but in the meantime, this is a quick, easy, and satisfying way to make another dent in the NSA’s armor.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all that you do,<br/>Evan, Tiffiniy, and Kevin<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. We think it’s important that we all take action today and help this Amendment pass if at all possible. But we also recognize it’s limitations. Everyone in the world deserves privacy, not just U.S. citizens. That’s why we’re continuing to build a global movement around Reset the Net.
