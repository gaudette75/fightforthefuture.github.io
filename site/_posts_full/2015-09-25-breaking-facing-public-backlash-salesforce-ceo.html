<h2><i>Says letter supporting cyber threat sharing legislation was “a mistake” and that he’s “against it”</i></h2><p><i>UPDATE: The entire Business Software Alliance, representing Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Adobe, and others, has now <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> clarifying that it does not support CISA.</i></p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>September 25, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer,<br/><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><p>BREAKING: After digital rights group Fight for the Future’s <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">YouBetrayedUs.org</a> campaign sparked public outcry and generated more than 23,000 emails and <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/heroku" target="_blank">calls for a boycott</a>, the CEO of cloud computing firm Salesforce took to twitter today to clarify that his company does not support CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.<br/></p><p>CISA is a controversial “cybersecurity” bill that <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/oti/coalition-letter-from-55-civil-society-groups-security-experts-and-academics-opposing-cisa/" target="_blank">experts say</a> will endanger online privacy and security while failing to stop cyber attacks. Last week, Salesforce and a handful of other companies including Microsoft and Apple  <a href="http://www.bsa.org/~/media/Files/Policy/data/09142015CongLeadershipDataAgendaLetter.pdf" target="_blank">signed on to letter</a> sent to Congress by BSA, The Software Alliance. The letter urges “prompt action” by Congress to pass “Cyber Threat Information Sharing Legislation.” Given that the Senate is expected to take up CISA soon, and that CISA is the only “Cyber Threat Information Sharing Legislation” being considered, the letter was seen as a clear endorsement of the bill, sparking online outrage.</p><p>“The letter clearly was a mistake and doesn&rsquo;t imply CISA support. We need to clarify. I&rsquo;m against it,” Marc Benioff <a href="https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/647431090400010240" target="_blank">tweeted</a> today. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/647422363890544640" target="_blank">separate tweet</a> he clarified, “Contrary to reports, Salesforce doesn’t support the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA.)” He also linked to <a href="http://trust.salesforce.com" target="_blank">trust.salesforce.com</a>, a page that does not appear to mention CISA or other Salesforce policy positions. Benioff appeared to spend quite a bit of time on twitter this morning, replying to many twitter users who had tweeted about Salesforce’s support for misguided cybersecurity legislation.</p><p>“It’s great to see the Internet flexing its muscles and showing its power to defend itself once again,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, “Salesforce responding to our boycott by backing away from support for CISA is a huge victory for the rights of Internet users everywhere. Any company that expects its users&rsquo; trust must clearly and vocally oppose CISA and any bill like it.”</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights group best known for organizing massive online protests <a href="http://sopastrike.com/" target="_blank">against SOPA</a> and for <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">net neutrality</a>.
