<p id="docs-internal-guid-cd6cb100-d218-15c8-a29b-fba96a425957"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.battleforthenet.com/comcast?org=fff" target="_blank">Urgent: there are just a few days left to stop Comcast from taking over Time Warner Cable and controlling most of the Internet. Click here to take action now.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This one really requires no explanation. The most hated company in the US is trying to take over the second most hated company in the US, in a move that would raise our cable and Internet bills, stifle online free speech, and make them one of the most powerful lobbies in history. [1]</span></p>
<p><span>This merger is bad for EVERYONE, and there is tons of opposition, even from within the FCC. We have a real chance at stopping this but we have to act quickly. [2]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.battleforthenet.com/comcast?org=fff" target="_blank">The deadline is next week! Click here to stop Comcast in its tracks.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Comcast is already the largest and most powerful opponent of net neutrality, online privacy, and Internet freedom. They’ve been caught several times abusing their “gatekeeper” power as an Internet provider to further their own interests. [3] If the FCC lets Comcast forcibly absorb Time Warner Cable &ndash; the second largest Internet provider in the U.S. &ndash; they will control access to information in nearly 6 of 10 people’s homes (more if you&rsquo;re only counting truly high speed Internet). [4]</span></p>
<p><span><span>Millions of you have sent comments to the FCC in support of net neutrality. We’re asking for your help again because </span><span>if this merger goes through, Comcast gets even more powerful &ndash; in the marketplace, online, and in Washington, DC.</span><span> If we don’t stop this takeover right now, we&rsquo;ll be fighting an uphill battle on net neutrality and online free speech for years to come.</span></span></p>
