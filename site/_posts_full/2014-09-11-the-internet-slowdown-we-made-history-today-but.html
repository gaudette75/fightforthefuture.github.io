<p><span>So far today we’ve driven 525,000 comments to the FCC from our site alone, and we melted phones in Washington, DC with more than 193,000 phone calls to Congress and the White House. </span><span>That’s outstanding!</span><span> But Cable companies like Comcast and Verizon are spending more than $1 million every week lobbying politicians in DC to ignore the public’s voice on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s make ourselves impossible to ignore. Are you with us?<br/><br/>Yours for the Internet,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, Jeff, Vasjen, and Jessica<br/></span><a href="http://twitter.com/fightfortheftr" target="_blank"><span><strong>Fight for the Future</strong><br/></span></a></p>
