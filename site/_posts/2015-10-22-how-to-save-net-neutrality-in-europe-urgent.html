October 27, the European Parliament will vote on rules intended to

EU and is much weaker than current rules in the United 
States. <br></p>
<p><b>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not too late to change course.</b> Members of 
Parliament can still secure meaningful network neutrality for 
Europe&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;if they adopt key amendments on Tuesday.</p>
