<p><i>Fight for the Future joined 29 other organizations in an open letter to Facebook&rsquo;s CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling for Facebook to stop its disingenuous campaign&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;users to support&nbsp;&ldquo;Free Basics&rdquo; in India. See the full text of the letter below. Contact: press@fightforthefuture.org for additional comment.</i></p>
<p>Dear Mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>You have said that &ldquo;connecting the world is one of the greatest challenges of our generation.&rdquo; We all agree. We also believe that a connectivity agenda must respect the right of all to equally access, receive and impart information. For this reason, we are concerned about Facebook&rsquo;s recent attacks on the millions of internet users in India and around the world who have fought, and who continue to fight, for Net Neutrality.</p>
